== README

An old ruby on rails project I worked on to refresh myself on the language as well as work with some jQuery.  It allows you to add books, music, tv shows, or movies to a list. You can drag and drop these items to rank them in the order that you want to experience them.  You can also mark an item as watched or listened to or read to remove it from the list.  All database updates were handled by ajax handlers.
